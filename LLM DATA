Reduce Stress: 
Sit comfortably in a quiet space, keeping your spine straight and your eyes gently closed. Take a moment to notice any tension or stress in your body, acknowledging it without judgment. Gradually begin to bring your attention to the sensation of your breath. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, allowing your chest and abdomen to fully expand. As you exhale through your mouth, let go of any tension or worry, releasing it with your breath. Continue to breathe deeply, focusing on the natural rhythm of your inhales and exhales. As thoughts arise, gently let them dissolve, refocusing your attention on the sensation of your breath. Notice the coolness as you breathe in, and the warmth as you breathe out. If your mind wanders, return your focus to the breath, without attachment or frustration. With each breath, feel a sense of calmness and tranquility washing over you. Embrace the present moment fully, accepting it as it is, and allowing any stress or worry to dissipate with each exhale. Keep the mind anchored on the breath, completely absorbed in this deep, rhythmic cycle. As the meditation nears its end, appreciate the stillness you have cultivated within. Take a moment to reflect on the benefits this practice brings to your overall well-being. Gently transition back into your daily activities, carrying the calm and clarity that this meditation has bestowed upon you.
